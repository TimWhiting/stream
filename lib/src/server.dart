abstract class StreamServer {
  /** Constructor.
   *
   * ##Request Handlers
   *
   * A request handler is responsible for handling a request. It is mapped
   * to particular URI patterns with [uriMapping].
   *
   * The first argument of a handler must be [HttpConnect]. It can have optional
   * arguments. If it renders the response, it doesn't need to return anything
   * (i.e., `void`). If not, it shall return an URI (which is a non-empty string,
   * starting with * `/`) that the request shall be forwarded to.
   *
   * ##WebSocket Handling
   * 
   * To handle WebSockets, you can prefix the URI mapping with `'ws:'`,
   * and then implement a WebSocket handler. A WebSocket handler has a
   * single argument and the argument type must be [WebSocket]. For example,
   *
   *     new StreamServer(uriMapping: {
   *       socket.listen((event) {
   *         //event is the message sent by the client
   *         //you can handle it and return a message as follows:
   *         socket.add("Server received: $evt");
   *       });
   *       return socket.done;
   *     }).start();
   *
   * ##Arguments
   *
   * * [homeDir] - the home directory for holding static resources. If not specified,
   * it is the root directory of the application.
   * You can specify a relative path relative to the root
   * directory. For example, you can create a directory called `static` to hold
   * the static resources, and then specify `static` as the home directory.
   *     > The root directory is assumed to the parent directory of the `webapp`
   *     > directory if it exists. Otherwise, it is assumed to be the directory where
   *     > the `main` Dart file is. For example, if you execute `dart /foo1/myapp.dart`,
   *     > the root is assumed to be `/foo1`. On the other hand, if executing
   *     > `dart /foo2/webapp/myapp.dart`, then the root is `/foo2`.
   * * [uriMapping] - a map of URI mappings, `<String uri, RequestHandler handler>`
   * or `<String uri, String forwardURI>`.
   * The key is a regular expression used to match the request URI. If you can name
   * a group by prefix with a name, such as `'/dead-link(info:.*)'`.
   * The value can be the handler for handling the request, or another URI that this request
   * will be forwarded to. If the value is a URI and the key has named groups, the URI can
   * refer to the group with `(the_group_name)`.
   * For example: `'/dead-link(info:.*)': '/new-link(info)'`.
   * * [filterMapping] - a map of filter mapping, `<String uri, RequestFilter filter>`.
   * The key is a regular expression used to match the request URI.
   * The signature of a filter is `void foo(HttpConnect connect, void chain(HttpConnect conn))`.
   * * [errorMapping] - a map of error mapping. The key can be a number, an instance of
   * exception, a string representing a number, or a string representing the exception class.
   * The value can be an URI or a renderer function. The number is used to represent a status code,
   * such as 404 and 500. The exception is used for matching the caught exception.
   * Notice that, if you specify the name of the exception to handle,
   * it must include the library name and the class name, such as `"stream.ServerError"`.
   * * [futureOnly] - whether every request handler shall return a Future instance.
   * If false (default), a request handler can return null (or nothing) to indicate
   * the request has been served immediately. However, it is also a common error -- forget
   * to return a Future object. To avoid this problem, you can return a Future object
   * in each your handler, and then specify this argument to true to have Stream server
   * to ensure it.

  /** The prefix used to denote a different version of JavaScript or Dart code,
   * such that the browser will reload the JavaScript files automatically.
   * It will be removed before the URI mapping and  it is not visible to
   * the request handler. For example, you can generate the JavaScript link as
   * follows in RSP:
   *
   *     <script src="[=connect.server.uriVersionPrefix]/js/init.js"></script>
   *
   * Then, no matter the value of [uriVersionPrefix], the file at `/js/init.js`
   * will always be loaded.
   *
   * > Default: "" (no special prefix at all). Notice the value must start

   *
   * ##Typical Use
   *
   * You usually assign a build number to it when the server is restarted:
   *
   *     server.uriVersionPrefix = "/$buildNumber";
   *
   * Then, the browser will reload the JavaScript code automatically each
   * time the build number is changed.
   *
   * You can prefix it to the image that depends on the build number too.
   *
   * ##The script Tag
   *
   * The [script](http://docs.rikulo.org/stream/latest/RSP/Standard_Tags/script.html)
   * tag supports [uriVersionPrefix] automatically, so you don't need to
   * (and shall not) prefix the URI with this:
   *
   *     [:script src="/js/init.dart"] [!-- no need to prefix uriVersionPrefix --]
